## Tanner Austin's Portfolio 
https://wrugby1.github.io/Portfolio/

This project acts as a front page for my coding work and experience. I have linked various projects that I have either created myself or collaborated on. 

In my portfolio you will find a homepage that introduces myself, a portfolio page that displays my work, and a contact page that holds my relevant contact information. 

This portfolio was created mainly using bootstrap CDN, and is built to be a responsive site.
